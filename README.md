### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Junior year Information Science major at Cornell University pursuing a concentration in User Experience Design and a minor in Computer Science. As a developer, I make things that live in the browser, where people across a wide variety of platforms can interface with the things I build and where designs become living breathing client-side applications that serve the needs of others.

I love user interfaces and I am passionate about understanding and confronting all the challenges that their design and implementation present. As such, I am pursuing a major in Information Science to gear myself with a solid foundation across software engineering and human-computer interaction design principles. I strive to ensure that the code I write is readable, efficient, and well-tested, and that the interfaces I develop are responsive, accessible, and performant.

I'm pursuing employment as a Frontend Software Engineer, and to that end I have been refining my development skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. Though the web is my focus, I would love to delve into open-source projects for desktop or mobile devices and I hope that my interdisciplinary background can help me bring in a unique perspective when working on user interface related challenges.

# Fun Facts About Me ðŸ‘¾

- My interest in user interfaces started with a childhood obsession with operating system graphical user interfaces, and I greatly admire the efforts of the teams behind the KDE Plasma and GNOME desktop environments among others.
- I'm a big fan of the website art scene and have frequented creations such as Fauux's Neocities and Angus Nicneven's Terminal00.
- I love tea. I also love tea lattes. Starting my day with a London Fog Latte might get me called a tea heretic or heathen, but the joy of a hot cup of creamy bergamot goodness outweights the shame.
- I love a good nature walk and I'm starting to delve into the world of hiking and trails!
